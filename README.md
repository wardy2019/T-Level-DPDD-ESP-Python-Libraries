# T Level ESP Task 4a – Pandas & Matplotlib Knowledge Library

This repository contains a **complete knowledge library** for Task 4a of the T Level Digital Production, Design and Development ESP exam. It provides **fully PEP 8–compliant Python code examples** with inline comments, designed to support both **students revising for the assessment** and **Copilot knowledge agents** linking to this repo.

## What’s Included
- **index.html** – A self-contained reference page covering:
- Importing and reading CSV files with pandas  
- Selecting, filtering, and creating subsets  
- Counting, sorting, and finding extremes  
- Creating new columns  
- Grouping and summarising data  
- Working with dates and times  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Menus and mapping choices  
- Functions and comments  
- Formatting output  
- Graphing with matplotlib (bar, line, pie)  
- loc and iloc usage  
- Statistical methods (mean, min, max, sum)  
- Finding extremes (idxmax, idxmin)  
- Sorting grouped data  
- Core reusable patterns  
- Core syntax reference  

## Purpose
This resource has two main goals:
1. **Student Support** – A black-and-white, revision-friendly knowledge library that explains every pandas and matplotlib command needed for Task 4a.  
2. **AI Integration** – A structured, clean reference that can be linked with Copilot agents or other AI assistants for instant lookups.
